# UUScribe ASR Skill

Use UUScribe to transcribe a local audio file or a public, single-video YouTube URL from a compatible agent. The skill includes a Python standard-library client; no Python packages are needed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or newer and network access.
- A UUScribe account with API access and available transcription allowance. Create an API key in the UUScribe website under Settings → API Keys.
- Set `UUSCRIBE_API_KEY` in the agent process environment. The script does not read `skill.env` automatically. Never put a real key in this repository or in a chat message.
- For local audio, install `ffprobe` (part of FFmpeg). A public YouTube URL does not need it.

## Install and use

After this repository is published, compatible clients can install it from its GitHub URL with `npx skills add <owner>/uusscribe-asr-skill`. The `SKILL.md` file contains the agent workflow and safety rules. You can also run the bundled client directly:

```bash
python3 scripts/transcribe.py 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID' --submit-only
python3 scripts/transcribe.py --task-id TASK_ID --output transcript.json
python3 scripts/transcribe.py /path/to/audio.mp3
```

Use the returned task ID to resume an existing task. Submitting the same source again can create another billable task. UUScribe charges or consumes allowance according to the user's account and plan; installing this skill is free.
